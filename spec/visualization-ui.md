# Visualization & UI

## Decided

- **Visualization Tools**: Hyperfactory provides visualization tools for factory data
- **Custom Screens**: Includes the ability to create custom screens for factory workcenters/machines
- **Data Insights**: Provides insights into production data through visual interfaces

## Undecided

1. What technology stack for custom screens? (React, Vue, Svelte? Low-code platform?)
2. Do we build a custom dashboard builder, or integrate with Grafana/similar?
3. How do users create and customize screens for workcenters/machines?
4. Do we need mobile apps, or is web-only sufficient?
5. What's the user permission model? (Role-based, attribute-based?)
