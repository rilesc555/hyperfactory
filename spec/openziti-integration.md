# OpenZiti Integration

## Decided

- **Security Communication**: Hyperfactory uses OpenZiti for secure communication between devices and the cloud
- **Core Requirement**: OpenZiti is a fundamental component of the hyperfactory architecture for secure connectivity

## Undecided

1. How deeply integrated is OpenZiti? Is it required or optional?
2. Do edge devices connect directly through OpenZiti tunnels, or do we have a gateway pattern?
3. How do we handle OpenZiti identity provisioning during customer onboarding?
4. What's the fallback if OpenZiti has issues?
