# Odoo Integration

## Decided

- **ERP Integration**: Hyperfactory connects to an Odoo database to integrate with an ERP system
- **Purpose**: Provides insights into production data by combining factory data with ERP information

## Undecided

1. Which Odoo modules do we integrate with? (Manufacturing, Inventory, MRP, Quality?)
2. Is Odoo integration required or optional?
3. Do we use Odoo's API, or do we need direct database access?
4. How do we handle Odoo version compatibility (Community vs. Enterprise, different versions)?
5. Do we push data to Odoo, pull from Odoo, or both?
