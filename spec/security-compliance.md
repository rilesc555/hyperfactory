# Security & Compliance

## Decided

- **Secure Communication**: Uses OpenZiti for secure communication between devices and the cloud

## Undecided

1. What security certifications do we need? (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)
2. How do we handle customer data privacy? (GDPR, CCPA compliance?)
3. What's our vulnerability management process?
4. Do we support SSO/SAML for enterprise customers?
5. How do we handle audit logging?
