# Edge Deployment

## Decided

- **Edge Technology**: Edge deployments will use something like EdgeX Foundry to connect to PLCs, sensors, and other devices
- **Data Streaming**: Edge devices stream data to hyperfactory instances running in the cloud

## Undecided

1. What hardware requirements for edge devices? (CPU, RAM, storage)
2. What OS do we support? (Linux only, Windows, both?)
3. How do we handle edge device provisioning and initial setup?
4. Do we support air-gapped or offline-first edge deployments?
5. How do we handle edge device updates and configuration management?
6. What happens when edge devices lose cloud connectivity?
