# Machine Learning & Analytics

## Decided

- **ML Models**: Hyperfactory provides machine learning models for factory data analysis
- **Analytics Capability**: Includes analytics tools for processing and understanding factory data

## Undecided

1. What ML capabilities do we provide out of the box? (Predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, quality prediction?)
2. Do we train models in the cloud, at the edge, or both?
3. What ML framework/platform? (TensorFlow, PyTorch, MLflow, custom?)
4. How do users deploy custom models?
5. Do we need real-time inference at the edge?
