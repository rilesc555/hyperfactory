# OpenMetal Deployment

## Decided

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Hyperfactory instances run in the cloud on OpenMetal infrastructure
- **Deployment Target**: OpenMetal is the chosen cloud platform for hosting hyperfactory instances

## Undecided

1. What OpenMetal services do we use? (Bare metal, private cloud, managed Kubernetes?)
2. How do we handle scaling across multiple OpenMetal regions?
3. What's our deployment automation? (Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi, custom?)
4. How do we handle infrastructure monitoring and alerting?
