# Hyperfactory-Cloud (IaaS)

## Decided

- **Managed Service**: A cloud-based platform that provides a managed service for hyperfactory
- **Deployment Management**: Provides a simple way to deploy and manage hyperfactory instances
- **Instance Connectivity**: Provides a way to connect hyperfactory instances to each other and to the cloud
- **Customer Onboarding**: Customers will go to an online portal/form/chat (method still to be determined)
- **Quick Setup**: Answer questions about use case (device IPs/MAC addresses, etc.) and get a customized hyperfactory instance running in minutes
- **Customization**: Customers can customize their deployment after creation, including paying for more compute, bandwidth, and storage

## Undecided

1. What's the onboarding flow? (Portal, form, chat, wizard?)
2. How do we handle billing? (Usage-based, tiered plans, custom quotes?)
3. What payment processing? (Stripe, custom?)
4. How do customers manage their instances? (Web console, CLI, API, all three?)
5. Do we offer a free tier or trial period?
6. What SLAs do we commit to?
7. How do we handle customer data backup and disaster recovery?
8. Do we support customer-managed encryption keys?
