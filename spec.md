# Hyperfactory

This project has two main parts:

1. A core product called hyperfactory. This a platform inspired by the United Manufacturing Hub that enables factories to collect, process, and analyze data from various sources. It provides a unified namespace for all factory data, visualization tools, and machine learning models. It includes that ability to create custom screens/ for factory workcenters/machines. It connects to an odoo database to integrate with an ERP and provide insights into production data. It uses openziti for secure communication between devices and the cloud.

2. An IaaS called hyperfactory-cloud. This is a cloud-based platform that provides a managed service for hyperfactory. It provides a simple way to deploy and manage hyperfactory instances. It also provides a way to connect hyperfactory instances to each other and to the cloud. Customers will be able to go to an online portal/form/chat (still to be determined), answer some questions about their use case (device ips/mac addresses, etc.) and get a customized hyperfactory instance up and running in minutes. They will be able to customize their deployment after creating it from this screen, including paying for more compute, bandwidth, and storage.
